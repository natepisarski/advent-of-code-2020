# Advent of Code 2020 - KOTLIN EDITION
This is going to be an attempt at Advent of Code 2020. It's being implemented as
one giant Kotlin project, that can use an Enum to produce answers for different days.

This is my first attempt at writing Kotlin, and first Advent of Code (and as such is a learning experience). Anyone
who decides to read or use any of this code will probably be disgusted, especially during the earlier
challenges.

If, for whatever reason, you'd like to use this code for the challenge or for something you're working on, feel free to.

As the month goes on I'll try to add a bit more extensibility to the program itself, so that you can
do things like supply Command-Line Arguments that correspond to a day and a part, and receive that day/part's Answer.

Currently the project only supports the notion of Days, so they will produce Part 2's answer. However, you will find that
the classes used for the Solutions have derelict functions with complete implementations for part 1.
